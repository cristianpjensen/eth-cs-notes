\section{Structure from motion} \label{sec:sfm}

In structure from motion (SfM), we have $m$ images of $n$ fixed
three-dimensional points. We then want to estimate the camera matrices of all
images and the positions of the points.

\end{figure}

Idea: Initialize 3D structure by triangulation from two images. Then, for each
additional view, determine the camera matrix and 2D-3D correspondences, and
refine/extend the 3D structure by triangulation (see last assignment).
