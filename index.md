## Natural Language Processing, F23

This course comprises fundamental NLP algorithms for efficiently computing probability distributions over structures. It covers backpropagation, log-linear modelling, multi-layer perceptrons, recurrent neural networks, language modelling, semirings for generalizing algorithms, part-of-speech tagging with conditional random fields and the backward/forward algorithm, transliteration with finite-state automata and Lehmann's algorithm, constituency parsing with the CKY algorithm, dependency parsing with the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm, semantic parsing with linear-indexed grammars and combinatory categorial grammars, transformers in the context of translation.

## Computer Vision, F23

This course comprises many computer vision applications and gives an overview of the research within that area. It covers the Harris detector, deep learning, optical flow, recognition, segmentation, object detection, tracking, projective geometry, the camera model, epipolar geometry, structure from motion, and stereo matching.

## Algorithms Lab, F23

This course consisted of solving many problems using algorithms learned during a datastructures and algorithms class, in C++. Methods covered include binary search, graph algorithms, infinite precision computing, greedy algorithms, split and list, maximum flow, minimum cost maximum flow, Delaunay triangulation, and linear programming.

## Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence, F23

This course first covers how to represent uncertainty using Bayesian linear regression, Gaussian processes, and Bayesian neural networks, and goes over several methods for making the intractable probability distribution over outputs tractable. The covered methods are variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo. Secondly, it covers how to make use of this uncertainty in concepts such as active learning, Bayesian optimization, Markov decision processes, and reinforcement learning.
